<!-- Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering: -->

- You can see the demo at: https://windbnb-firme.vercel.app/
- This is a project built for educational propose, when I started coding this app I faced some issues such as difficulties while trying to manage global states in React Js, at the end everything did work properly.
- I learnt how to implement global states using react, using a wonderful lib called Zustand, instead of using the built in Context API.
- I'm a web developer and Product designer. When it comes to javascript I do prefer Vue.js because everything looks easier. Currently learning React beacause it's a lib with a larger community, so corporations are often looking for a React developer.

## User Story
- I can see a list of properties
- I can see the property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
- I can open the filter drawer
- I can filter properties by location and number of guests
- I can see the number of filtered items
